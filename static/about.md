## About

OpenEFT is an open-source program created to allow anyone to generate ~~edit, and correct~~ their own .EFT files for use with the ATF's eForm application.

----

##### Purpose

This program exists to simplify the NFA process and reduce overall costs.

The NFA should be easy. Instead, it's expensive. The ATF collects $200 of your hard-earned money, your FFL takes another $100 (give-or-take) for a Form 4 transfer, and then you pay another $65 just to have your fingerprints converted to a digital file.

That's basically half the price of a another suppressor. Let's change that.

----

##### Maintenance, Support, and Questions

This fork is maintained by your friendly neighborhood FFL (me).

Please [open an issue or start a discussion on Github](https://github.com/lbussy/OpenEFT/) with any problems. I love feedback, but I don't have time to answer support calls at my shop :)
